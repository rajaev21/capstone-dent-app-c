Limitations of the Study
While the system enhances efficiency,there are some limitations:
Focused on small-scale operations – The system is primarily intended for focused and small-scale use, specifically tailored to meet the needs of Salapantan Dental Clinic in San Miguel, Iloilo. It is not designed for multi-branch or large-scale dental clinic networks, making it ideal only for localized, individual clinic operations.
Internet Dependency – The project relies on an internet connection to function properly. If there’s no internet, users may not be able to access the system, schedule appointments, or manage existing bookings, which can disrupt operations.
Inventory Purchasing - The system will not cover the process of purchasing inventories.
